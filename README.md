## Explore US Bikeshare Data With Python
I utilized Python-based programming to gather data on bike-sharing systems in three locations throughout the United States. I used Python to investigate the many bike-sharing programs in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. To solve a critical data problem, I created software that would export the data and provide descriptive statistics. To build an interactive representation of this data, you may use a script that receives input from the terminal directly.
